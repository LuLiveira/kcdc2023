= Setting up the project

== Tooling used
* *JDK 1.8.0_281* (or later version of Java 8) installed on your computer
* *JDK 20.0.1* (or later version of Java 20) installed on your computer
* *Apache Maven 3.8.6* installed on your computer
* *IntelliJ* or similar IDE for Java.
* A *toolchains.xml* file (similar to the one in the root of this project)
** The toolchains point to JDK 8 and 20 used in the project.

== Initial setup
. Launch the project in the IDE (can be configured as a maven project, pointing to the root pom.xml, and the toolchains.xml for JDKs used)

=== Test Java 8 code:

. Verify that the module *kcdc-java8 used JDK 8* (note, do not rely on source/target compatibility in the IDE force set the module to use JDK 8).
. Run the App.java under link:../../kcdc-java8/src/main/java/conf/App.java[App.java]
. Verify output.

=== Test Java 20 code:

. Verify that the module *kcdc-java20 used JDK 20* (experimental features should be allowed).
. Run the App.java under link:../../kcdc-java20/src/main/java/conf/App.java[App.java]
. Verify output looks structurally similar to the one frmo kcdc-java8.

=== Update the Java 8 module to use Java 20

. Find instances of FIXME #0 in the kcdc-java8 link:../../kcdc-java8/pom.xml[pom.xml]. Fix per advise.
. Ensure that the module kcdc-java8 now uses Java 20 as its JDK.
. Follow the numbered FIXME instructions to learn great features added to Java from Java 8 until Java 20!
